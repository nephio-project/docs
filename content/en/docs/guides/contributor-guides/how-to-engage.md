## Structure

The Nephio community is organised into different Special Interrest Groups (SIG) and the technical work is overseed by
the Technical Steering Committee (TSC).

SIGs are organized around specific technical issues. 

* SIG1 - Network Architecture
* SIG2 - Automation
* SIG3 - Relase
* SIG4 - Security 


## Community meetings and calendar

Nephio community have several different meetings. The TSC and SIGs have their regular meetings plus some topics are
discussed in their own regular calls. All the meetings of the Nephio community are listed in the
[community calendar](https://lists.nephio.org/g/main/calendar?consolidated=1).

All the meetings in the calendar are open for everyone, there is not need for membership, no need to be a contributor of
the project to call in and share one's opinion.  

## Wiki

[Wiki](https://lf-nephio.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HOME/overview?mode=global) is used to share information about the
operations of the project. There are no strict rules for what kind of information is stored in the wiki. Some teams
store all their meeting minutes in the wiki, but others use Google Docs for the same reason. 

The wiki collects all these references.

All wiki pages can be seen without logging in to the wiki, but to edit or create pages a login is needed.

### SIG Wikipages

Each SIG has its own wiki page:

* [SIG1 - Network Architecture](https://lf-nephio.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HOME/SIG+Network+Architecture)
* [SIG2 - Automation](https://lf-nephio.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HOME/SIG+Automation)
* [SIG3 - Relase](https://lf-nephio.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HOME/SIG+Release)
* [SIG4 - Security](https://lf-nephio.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HOME/SIG+Security)

These wiki pages contain references to the calendars, meeting notes, YouTube playlists and working groups os the SIG.

## Slack

Day to day communication happens on Slack, community members discuss technical topics and other project related issues
there. Both TSC and all the SIGs have their separate channels but there are topic specific channels. To get the list of
available channels you can get to the list of all channels by clicking *Channels -> Manage -> Browse channels*.
