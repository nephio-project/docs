# Developer guide

This developer guide is for for people who want to write code for the Nephio project. This document is written as an
extension of the [Kubernetes Developer Guides](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/devel#the-process-of-developing-and-contributing-code-to-the-kubernetes-project)
and therefore covers topics that are specific to Nephio development.

* How to set up a [Minimal Development Environment]({{< relref "minimal-environment.md" >}}) defines common terminology
  used in the Nephio project.
