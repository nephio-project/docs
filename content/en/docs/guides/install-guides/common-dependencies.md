title: Installing common dependencies
description: >
  This guide describes how to install some required dependencies that are the same across all environments.

Some of these, like the resource-backend, will move out of the "required"
category in later releases.  Even if you do not use these directly in your
installation, the CRDs that come along with them are necessary.

If you want to use a version other than that of `v3.0.0` of Nephio `catalog` repo, then replace the `@origin/v3.0.0` suffix on the package URLs on the `kpt pkg get` commands below with the tag/branch of the version you wish to use.

While using KPT you can [either pull a branch or a tag](https://kpt.dev/book/03-packages/01-getting-a-package) from a git repository. By default it pulls the tag. In case, you have branch with the same name as a tag then to:

```bash
#pull a branch 
kpt pkg get --for-deployment <git-repository>@origin/v3.0.0
#pull a tag
kpt pkg get --for-deployment <git-repository>@v3.0.0
```

## Network Config Operator

This component is a controller for applying configuration to routers and
switches.

```bash
kpt pkg get --for-deployment https://github.com/nephio-project/catalog.git/nephio/optional/network-config@@origin/v3.0.0
kpt fn render network-config
kpt live init network-config
kpt live apply network-config --reconcile-timeout=15m --output=table
```

## Resource Backend

The resource backend provides IP and VLAN allocation.

```bash
kpt pkg get --for-deployment https://github.com/nephio-project/catalog.git/nephio/optional/resource-backend@@origin/v3.0.0
kpt fn render resource-backend
kpt live init resource-backend
kpt live apply resource-backend --reconcile-timeout=15m --output=table
```

## Setup a Downstream Git Repository 

Nephio needs a git repository (as a source of truth) to store the packages 
which are getting deployed or are already deployed on the cluster. Either you can use Github/Gitlab or Gitea. If you want to use [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/), 
then you can follow below steps:

```bash
kpt pkg get --for-deployment https://github.com/nephio-project/catalog.git/distros/sandbox/gitea@@origin/v3.0.0
kpt fn render gitea
kpt live init gitea
kpt live apply gitea --reconcile-timeout 15m --output=table
```

You can find the Gitea ip-address via `kubectl get svc -n gitea` 
and use port `3000` to access it with login `nephio` and password `secret`.
