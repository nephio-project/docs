The Nephio documentation provides a comprehensive collection of step-by-step guides. These guides
are complete worked examples made up of multiple tasks that guide the user through a relatively
simple but realistic scenario: building an application that uses some of your projectâ€™s features,
for example. If you have already created some examples for your project, you can base tutorials on
them. This section is optional. However, remember that, although you may not need this section at
first, having tutorials can be useful to help your users engage with your example code, especially
if there are aspects that need more explanation than you can easily provide in code comments.

The Guides fall into three categories: install guides, user guides, and contributor guides.
