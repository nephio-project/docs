## Overview

Helm integration support in Nephio is currently under investigation 
and will progress over the coming releases.  

Although the direction from Nephio is to encourage the use of 
[operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) 
for deploying on Kubernetes, legacy helm support will be required for a number of releases.

### Deployment options
