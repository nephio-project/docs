SIG1 Network Architecture focuses on defining and developing network architecture by identifying and/or exercising Nephio's enablers. The group's work is guided by user stories that capture the needs and priorities of stakeholders, such as network administrators, security officers, engineers, and end-users.
The scope includes establishing guidelines for network design, security protocols, scalability solutions, performance optimization, and providing comprehensive documentation and training.
