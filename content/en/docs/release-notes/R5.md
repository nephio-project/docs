## Limitations

**<span style="color:red">These need to be reviewed, verified and updated accordingly</span>**

* Intercluster networking is not dynamic. Therefore, as more clusters are deployed, some manual tweaking will be needed 
for intercluster communications.
* Provisioning of the VLAN interfaces on the nodes is currently performed manually.
* Feedback of the workload deployments from the workload clusters to the management cluster is limited. 
You may need to connect directly to the workload cluster via kubectl to resolve any deployment issues.
* The web UI features are limited to the viewing and editing of packages, and resources in those packages, and their deployment. 
Additional features will be added in subsequent releases.
* When the capacities of the UPF, SMF, and AMF NFs are changed, the free5GC operator on the workload cluster will 
instantiate a new POD with correspondingly modified resources (CPU, memory, and so on). During this process, the pod will restart. This is a limitation of free5GC.
* Only Gitea works with automated cluster provisioning to create new repositories and join them to Nephio. 
To use a different Git provider, you must manually provision the cluster repositories, register them to the Nephio management server, and set up Config Sync on the workload cluster.
* The web UI does not require authentication in the current demo configuration. Testing of the web UI with authentication configured has not yet been done.
* The web UI only shows the resources in the default namespace.
* While many types of Git authentication are supported, testing has only been done with token-based Git authentication in Gitea.

## Known issues and workarounds

**<span style="color:red">These need to be reviewed, verified and updated accordingly</span>**

*  Packages may take time to be approved by the auto-approval controller. If they appear to have frozen, it may help to 
restart the Porch and the Nephio controllers using the following commands:

  ```bash
  kubectl -n porch-system rollout restart deploy porch-server
  kubectl -n nephio-system rollout restart deploy nephio-controller
  ```
* Occasional calls to `porchctl rpkg copy` may fail with the following message:

  `Error: Internal error occurred: error applying patch: conflict: fragment line
  does not match src line`.
  
  If such a message appears, then retry in a little while, as this error may resolve itself. Restarting Porch may also help.
