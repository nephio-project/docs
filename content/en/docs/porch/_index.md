## Overview

 Porch is “kpt-as-a-service”, providing opinionated package management, manipulation, and lifecycle operations in a
 Kubernetes-based API. This allows automation of these operations using standard Kubernetes controller techniques.

"Porch" is short for "Package Orchestration".

## Porch in the Nephio architecture, history and outlook

Porch is a key component of the Nephio architecture and was originally developed in the
[kpt](https://github.com/kptdev/kpt) project. When kpt was donated to the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/projects/kpt/) it
was decided that Porch would not be part of the kpt project and the code was donated to Nephio.

Porch is maintained by the Nephio community and is a core part of the Nephio architecture. Porch will evolve with Nephio and
its architecture and implementation will be updated to meet the functional and non-functional requirements on it
and on Nephio as a whole.
