## Using the porchctl cli


When Porch was ported to Nephio, the `kpt alpha rpkg` commands in kpt were moved into a new command called `porchctl`. 

To use it locally, [download](https://github.com/nephio-project/porch/releases), unpack and add it to your PATH.

_Optional: Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell to add to your profile._

```
porchctl completion bash
```

Check that porchctl is working:

```
porchctl --help

porchctl interacts with a Kubernetes API server with the Porch
server installed as an aggregated API server. It allows you to
manage Porch repository registrations and the packages within
those repositories.

Usage:
  porchctl [flags]
  porchctl [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  help        Help about any command
  repo        Manage package repositories.
  rpkg        Manage packages.
  version     Print the version number of porchctl

Flags:
  -h, --help                           help for porchctl
      --log-flush-frequency duration   Maximum number of seconds between log flushes (default 5s)
      --truncate-output                Enable the truncation for output (default true)
  -v, --v Level                        number for the log level verbosity

Use "porchctl [command] --help" for more information about a command.
