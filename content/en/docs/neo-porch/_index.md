The Kubernetes documentation follows a table of contents detailed in the below section. taking this template and adapting it to the porch code base/documentation we get the following.

1. The different sections required to be covered following the Kubernetes documentation.
2. The currently available documentation relating to this section available now on <https://docs.nephio.org/docs/porch/>.
3. The gaps/missing sections not found in the current documentation but required in the rework.

Sections marked as <span style="color: green;">[Section in Green]</span> means they have been reviewed and marked as necessary to be included in the new documentation.

Sections marked as <span style="color: red;">[Section in Red]</span> means they have not been reviewed but could still be placed in the docs in the given location once they are. TLDR its a topic of interest to be looked at just not signed off on yet as as a mandatory addition.

## 1. Overview

**Section Must Contain:**

* What is **Porch**
    • Short description (“Porch = package orchestration, opinionated package management …”) (Porch already has this under Overview). ([https://docs.nephio.org/docs/porch/](https://docs.nephio.org/docs/porch/))
* Goals & scope (what Porch intends to do, what it does *not* do)
* Audiences: which users should care (operators, GitOps engineers, developers, integrators, etc.)
* Prerequisites / compatibility (Kubernetes versions, environments, permissions, dependencies)

**Currently Available Resources:**

* **Porch documentation** ([https://docs.nephio.org/docs/porch/](https://docs.nephio.org/docs/porch/))
* *Overview* — what Porch is. (<https://docs.nephio.org/docs/porch/>) exists but requires refresh
* *Porch in the Nephio architecture, history and outlook* (exists but we should do away with it)

**Gaps / additions Required:**

* Statement of *goals & scope* (what Porch intends to do / NOT do).
* Target audiences (operators, developers, integrators).

## 3. Getting Started

* Using the Porch CLI / basic commands. Porch has *Using the Porch CLI tool*.

**Currently Available Resources:**

* [Installing Porch](https://docs.nephio.org/docs/porch/user-guides/install-porch/) needs quick version e.g. script containing (./scripts/setup-dev-env.sh + make run-in-kind)
* Preparing the Environment
* Using the Porch CLI tool
