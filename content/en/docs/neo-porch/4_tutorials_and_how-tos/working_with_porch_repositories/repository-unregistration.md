## Unregistering Repositories

When you no longer need Porch to manage packages from a repository, you can unregister it. This removes Porch's connection to the repository without affecting the underlying Git storage.

### Unregister a Repository

Remove a repository from Porch:

```bash
porchctl repo unregister porch-test --namespace default
```

**What this does:**

- Removes the Repository resource from Kubernetes
- Stops synchronizing packages from the repository
- Removes Porch's cached metadata for the repository
- Does not delete the underlying Git repository or its contents

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
Unregistering a repository does not delete the underlying Git repository or its contents. It only removes Porch's connection to it.
{{% /alert %}}

**Example output:**

```bash
porch-test unregistered
```

**What happens to packages:**

- **Published packages in Git**: Remain in the Git repository and are preserved. If you re-register the same repository later, these packages will reappear when Porch synchronizes.
- **Draft/Proposed packages pushed to Git**: Also remain in Git and will reappear upon re-registration.
- **Unpushed work-in-progress packages**: Cached packages that were never pushed to Git (draft packages being edited) are removed and cannot be recovered.
