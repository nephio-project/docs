## Old Porch Overview

Porch is “kpt-as-a-service”, providing opinionated package management, manipulation, and lifecycle operations in a
Kubernetes-based API. This allows automation of these operations using standard Kubernetes controller techniques.

"Porch" is short for "Package Orchestration".

## Porch in the Nephio architecture, history and outlook

Porch is a key component of the Nephio architecture. It was originally developed in the
[kpt](https://github.com/kptdev/kpt) project. When kpt was donated to the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/projects/kpt/) it
was decided that Porch would not be part of the kpt project and the code was donated to Nephio.

Porch is maintained by the Nephio community. Porch will evolve with Nephio and
its architecture and implementation will be updated to meet the functional and non-functional requirements on it
and on Nephio as a whole.
