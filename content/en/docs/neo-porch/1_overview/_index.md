## What is Porch

Porch is a specialization and orchestration tool for managing distributed systems. It helps GitOps engineers,
developers, integrators and telecom operators to manage complex systems in a cloud native environment.  Porch runs
[kpt](https://kpt.dev/) at a scale for package specialization. It provides collaboration and governance enablers and
integration with GitOps for the packages.

## Goals and scope of Porch

The goal of Porch is to orchestrate kpt packages in a configuration as code and GitOps context. It provides an API and a CLI as enablers to build lifecycle management, package repository management, package discovery, and authoring kpt packages. 

Porch does not intend to run mutation pipelines, package specialization and basic package manipulation in GitOps, but uses kpt for these operations.
