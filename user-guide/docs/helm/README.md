# Helm Integration in Nephio

## Overview

Helm integration support in Nephio is currently under investigation 
and will progress over the coming releases.  

Although the direction from Nephio is to encourage the use of 
[operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) 
for deploying on Kubernetes, legacy helm support will be required for a number of releases.

### Deployment options

* [Using Flux CD](https://github.com/nephio-project/docs/blob/main/user-guide/docs/helm/flux-helm.md)
* [Operator SDK](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/helm/)
